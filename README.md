# Hangman
Old bad coding

HangmanNoGraphics -
    This directory contains a wordlist and HangmanLogic, a text based version of hangman.
    It works but barely and touching the code will probably break it lol
    Everything is more or less done in a single method and it has zero readability
    Dates back to roughly late 2013- early 2014

OldHangman -
    Attempt from late 2015 ish at adding graphics to the HangmanLogic
    I started to make graphics classes but pretty quickly realized that the whole HangmanLogic needs to be rewritten

Game -
    Dates to early 2016, total rework of Hangman and all classes. Still pretty shitty java, but demonstrates an
    understanding of object orientation that wasnt present in the earliest version
